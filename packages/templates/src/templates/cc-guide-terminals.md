Terminal commands

Use terminals for long-running commands that should stay alive for the user,
such as dev servers, watch tasks, REPLs, and database consoles. A terminal is a
real persistent PTY and appears in the cc UI.

List and create require exactly one explicit scope:

  cc terminal list --thread <thread-id>
  cc terminal list --environment <environment-id>
  cc terminal list --machine <id-or-name> [--cwd <path>]

  cc terminal create --thread <thread-id> --command "pnpm dev"
  cc terminal create --environment <environment-id>
  cc terminal create --machine <id-or-name> [--cwd <path>]
    --host <id-or-name>                   Alias for --machine
    --title <title>                       Display title
    --cols <n>                            Initial terminal columns
    --rows <n>                            Initial terminal rows
    --attach                              Attach after creating
    --json                                Print machine-readable output

Machine names are resolved to an explicit machine ID. No scope defaults to the
server machine, and --cwd is valid only with --machine or --host.

All other operations need only the terminal ID. They also accept the scope
flags above and ignore them, so a command built for `list` or `create` still
runs:

  cc terminal show <terminal-id>
  cc terminal attach <terminal-id>        Ctrl-B d detaches
  cc terminal send <terminal-id> --text <text> [--enter]
    --stdin                               Read bytes from stdin instead of --text
  cc terminal resize <terminal-id> --cols <n> --rows <n>
  cc terminal rename <terminal-id> <title>
  cc terminal restart <terminal-id>       Atomically replaces it with a shell; does not replay the original command
  cc terminal close <terminal-id> [--if-clean]

  cc terminal output <terminal-id>
    --since-seq <n>                       Read output chunks from a sequence
    --tail-bytes <n>                      Bound output to latest N bytes
    --limit-chunks <n>                    Bound output to latest N chunks
    --json                                Print chunks, nextSeq, truncated, status, exitCode, and closeReason

  Output stays readable after the command exits: the machine keeps a finished
  terminal's scrollback for 30 minutes, until its daemon restarts, or until many
  newer terminals have exited. For an exited terminal the output is followed by
  `Terminal <id> exited with code N` on stderr. Once the scrollback is gone,
  output fails with `terminal_output_unavailable` and says why.

  cc terminal wait <terminal-id>
    --contains <text>                     Wait for new output containing text
    --regex <pattern>                     Wait for new output matching regex
    --exit                                Wait until the terminal exits
    --from-start                          Include existing scrollback
    --timeout <duration>                  Seconds, or a duration with a unit: 90s, 5m (default: 30s)
    --poll-interval <duration>            Milliseconds, or a duration with a unit (default: 500ms)

  When the terminal exits before the text appears, wait stops at once with exit
  code 124, the terminal's exit code, and the last output it printed. `--exit`
  prints the exit code.

For a dev server, prefer:

  cc terminal create --thread <thread-id> --title "pnpm dev" --command "pnpm dev"
  cc terminal wait <terminal-id> --contains "Local:" --timeout 120

Do not run long-lived servers as one-off foreground commands when the user will
need to inspect logs, refresh the page, or stop the process later.
